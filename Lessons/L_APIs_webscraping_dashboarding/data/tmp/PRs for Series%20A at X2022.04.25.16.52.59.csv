""We continue to be pleased with our business development efforts, especially so soon after legal merger last fall. Our results for the quarter reflect successes on both sides of the balance sheet within our community and commercial banks as well as many of our other lines of business, including mortgage, insurance and wealth management. Our results also reflect a stable net interest margin positioned for improvement, and continued strong credit quality."" Rollins continued, ""Additional first quarter highlights include the repurchase of 5.1 million shares of Company common stock under our share repurchase program. Our board also increased the Company common stock dividend during the first quarter to $0.22 per share. While taking these capital actions, we maintained strong capital metrics relative to both regulatory and internal capital targets.""Paul Murphy, Executive Vice Chairman, added ""As we look more closely at our front-line successes, we reported organic loan growth for the quarter of more than $300 million while organic deposit growth totaled over $750 million. We feel positive about our growth trajectory. Our loan growth for the quarter was primarily in our commercial and industrial portfolio. From a deposit growth standpoint, first quarter is historically a seasonally high quarter.""Earnings SummaryThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $112.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2022, compared with net income available to common shareholders of $79.2 million, or $0.77 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2021 and a net loss available to common shareholders of $37.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company reported adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $121.6 million, or $0.65 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $80.4 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2021 and $104.1 million, or $0.63 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company reported adjusted PPNR of $160.4 million, or 1.36 percent of average assets on an annualized basis, for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $106.5 million, or 1.76 percent of average assets on an annualized basis, for the first quarter of 2021 and $136.4 million, or 1.32 percent of average assets on an annualized basis, for the fourth quarter of 2021.Net Interest RevenueNet interest revenue was $311.8 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $172.8 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $271.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 2.92 percent for the first quarter of 2022, compared with 3.15 percent for the first quarter of 2021 and 2.90 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021.The increase in net interest revenue in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the linked quarter reflected the full quarter's impact of the legacy Cadence merger, as well as the impact of fourth quarter deployment of cash into loans and securities, and a slight increase in accretion. The first quarter's increase in net interest margin reflected the deployment of cash into securities and lower deposit costs, partially offset by loan growth coming on at lower yields. The balance sheet remains asset sensitive, with approximately 28 percent of loans floating and another 41 percent of loans variable as of March 31, 2022.Yields on net loans, loans held for sale, and leases excluding accretion, were 3.96 percent for the first quarter of 2022, compared with 4.06 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021, while yields on total interest earning assets were 3.10 percent for the first quarter of 2022, compared with 3.11 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021. The average cost of deposits declined to 0.15 percent for the first quarter of 2022, compared with 0.17 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021. Net interest income for the first quarter of 2022 included $17.7 million in accretion income related to acquired loans and leases, adding approximately 17 basis points to the net interest margin. This compares to net accretion income of $16.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, which added approximately 17 basis points to the fourth quarter 2021 net interest margin. Excluding the impact of accretion, the linked quarter net interest margin increased by 3 basis points.Balance Sheet ActivityLoans and leases, net of unearned income, continued to reflect solid growth, increasing $306.7 million, or 4.6 percent annualized, to $27.2 billion during the first quarter of 2022 while deposits and customer repos increased $766.8 million, or 7.7 percent annualized, to $41.3 billion. Loan growth for the quarter was primarily within the commercial and industrial portfolio while deposit growth was largely attributable to increases in noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts. The first quarter has been a strong deposit growth quarter historically as a result of seasonality in municipal deposit account balances. The first quarter of 2022 ended with a loan to deposit ratio of 67.0 percent and securities to total assets of 30.4 percent, reflecting continued strong balance sheet liquidity. Noninterest bearing deposits represented 35.6 percent of total deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2022, representing an increase from 34.2 percent at December 31, 2021. Provision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit LossesCredit metrics for the first quarter of 2022 continued to reflect improvement compared to the linked quarter including net recoveries and a meaningful decrease in non-performing loans.Total non-performing loans and leases were $119.3 million at March 31, 2022, or 0.44 percent of total net loans and leases, representing a decline of $34.5 million or 22.4 percent, from the December 31, 2021 balance of $153.8 million or 0.57 percent of total net loans and leases. Other real estate owned and other repossessed assets also declined to $28.4 million at March 31, 2022, a decrease of $2.2 million or 14.0 percent, from the December 31, 2021 balance of $33.0 million.Net recoveries for the first quarter of 2022 were $0.4 million, or 0.01 percent of net loans and leases on an annualized basis, compared with net charge-offs of $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2021 and net recoveries of $4.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Earnings for the first quarter of 2022 reflected no recorded provision for credit losses, compared with no recorded provision for the first quarter of 2021 and a provision for credit losses of $133.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The provision for the fourth quarter of 2021 includes $132.1 million associated with day one accounting provision required for loans and unfunded commitments acquired during the quarter from the legacy Cadence merger. The allowance for credit losses remains robust at $438.7 million, or 1.61 percent of net loans and leases at March 31, 2022, compared with $446.4 million, or 1.66 percent of net loans and leases at December 31, 2021. Noninterest RevenueNoninterest revenue was $128.4 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $87.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $103.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The linked quarter increase was driven by a full quarter of legacy Cadence results as well as an increase in mortgage revenue as a result of increased mortgage servicing rights valuation. The net return from mortgage servicing rights was $14.0 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Mortgage production and servicing revenue was impacted by both seasonality and rising rates, totaling $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $17.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $8.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Mortgage origination volume for the first quarter of 2022 was $803.9 million, compared with $789.8 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $817.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Insurance commission revenue reflected strong seasonal performance at $35.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $30.7 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $32.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The first quarter of the year has historically been strong due to timing of annual renewals.The full quarter's impact of the legacy Cadence merger drove the linked quarter increases in wealth management revenue, deposit service fees and other noninterest revenue. Wealth management revenue was $21.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $16.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, deposit service charge revenue was $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared with $17.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, and other noninterest revenue was $18.3 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $14.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Credit card, debit card and merchant fee revenue was $12.1 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $12.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 reflecting seasonally soft first quarter fees.Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $291.7 million, compared with $155.8 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $289.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $281.0 million, compared with $154.2 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $239.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.5 percent for the first quarter of 2022, stable as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in adjusted noninterest expense compared to the linked quarter was due to a full quarter of the legacy Cadence merger as well as seasonally higher compensation costs including payroll taxes and 401k match, partially offset by initial efficiencies associated with the legacy Cadence merger. Adjusted noninterest expense excludes merger expense included as a separate line item on the income statement as well as incremental merger related expenses that are included in the respective expense categories. Merger expenses represent costs to complete the merger with no future benefit, while incremental merger related expenses represent costs to complete the merger for which the entity receives a future benefit. Merger expense was $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $44.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Merger expense for the first quarter of 2022 was comprised primarily of contract and conversion related expenses as well as compensation related items. Incremental merger related expenses for the first quarter of 2022 totaled $6.6 million that included primarily employee retention and marketing related expenses.Capital ManagementTotal shareholder's equity was $4.64 billion at March 31, 2021 compared with $2.83 billion at March 31, 2021 and $5.25 billion at December 31, 2021. The decline in the linked quarter is largely due to a decline in Other Comprehensive Income (""OCI"") due to increased unrealized losses in the available-for-sale securities portfolio driven by changes in valuation due to the significant changes in interest rates in the quarter. In addition to the OCI change, shareholder's equity was impacted by dividends and share repurchases, partially offset by earnings.The Company's ratio of shareholders' equity to assets was 9.84 percent at March 31, 2022, compared with 10.95 percent at March 31, 2021 and 11.01 percent at December 31, 2021. The ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets was 6.31 percent at March 31, 2022, compared with 7.04 percent at March 31, 2021 and 7.54 percent at December 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company repurchased 5.1 million shares of its common stock pursuant to its share repurchase program. The company has 4.9 million shares remaining on its current share repurchase authorization which will expire December 30, 2022. Additionally during the first quarter of 2022, the Company increased its quarterly common share dividend to $0.22 per common share, representing the 10th continuous year of increased dividends.Estimated regulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2022 included Common Equity Tier 1 capital of 10.57 percent, Tier 1 capital of 11.05 percent, Total risk-based capital of 13.27 percent, and Tier 1 leverage capital of 8.24 percent.

The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures in this release for the applicable periods presented. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provides important supplemental information that contributes to a proper understanding of the Company's capital position and adjusted performance, (ii) enables a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and (iii) allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP financial measures, and the Company strongly encourages investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this news release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure.

Given the legacy Cadence merger closed on October 29, 2021, the first quarter of 2022 represents the first full quarter of combined earnings.Highlights for the first quarter of 2022 included:The new logo for Cadence Bank (NYSE: CADE). (PRNewsfoto/Cadence Bank)Achieved quarterly net income available to common shareholders of $112.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share, and adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $121.6 million, or $0.65 per diluted common share. Reported $160.4 million in adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue (PPNR), or 1.36 percent of average assets on an annualized basis. Generated net organic loan growth of approximately $307 million for the quarter, or 4.6 percent on an annualized basis compared to linked quarter and total deposit and customer repo growth of approximately $767 million, or 7.7 percent on an annualized basis compared to linked quarter. Continued stability in credit quality metrics including net recoveries of $0.4 million and a 22.4 percent decline in total non-performing loans and leases; no provision for credit losses for the quarter. Repurchased 5.1 million shares of outstanding Company common stock resulting in 183.5 million shares outstanding as of March 31, 2022.

""We continue to be pleased with our business development efforts, especially so soon after legal merger last fall. Our results for the quarter reflect successes on both sides of the balance sheet within our community and commercial banks as well as many of our other lines of business, including mortgage, insurance and wealth management. Our results also reflect a stable net interest margin positioned for improvement, and continued strong credit quality."" Rollins continued, ""Additional first quarter highlights include the repurchase of 5.1 million shares of Company common stock under our share repurchase program. Our board also increased the Company common stock dividend during the first quarter to $0.22 per share. While taking these capital actions, we maintained strong capital metrics relative to both regulatory and internal capital targets.""Paul Murphy, Executive Vice Chairman, added ""As we look more closely at our front-line successes, we reported organic loan growth for the quarter of more than $300 million while organic deposit growth totaled over $750 million. We feel positive about our growth trajectory. Our loan growth for the quarter was primarily in our commercial and industrial portfolio. From a deposit growth standpoint, first quarter is historically a seasonally high quarter.""Earnings SummaryThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $112.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2022, compared with net income available to common shareholders of $79.2 million, or $0.77 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2021 and a net loss available to common shareholders of $37.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company reported adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $121.6 million, or $0.65 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $80.4 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2021 and $104.1 million, or $0.63 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company reported adjusted PPNR of $160.4 million, or 1.36 percent of average assets on an annualized basis, for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $106.5 million, or 1.76 percent of average assets on an annualized basis, for the first quarter of 2021 and $136.4 million, or 1.32 percent of average assets on an annualized basis, for the fourth quarter of 2021.Net Interest RevenueNet interest revenue was $311.8 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $172.8 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $271.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 2.92 percent for the first quarter of 2022, compared with 3.15 percent for the first quarter of 2021 and 2.90 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021.The increase in net interest revenue in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the linked quarter reflected the full quarter's impact of the legacy Cadence merger, as well as the impact of fourth quarter deployment of cash into loans and securities, and a slight increase in accretion. The first quarter's increase in net interest margin reflected the deployment of cash into securities and lower deposit costs, partially offset by loan growth coming on at lower yields. The balance sheet remains asset sensitive, with approximately 28 percent of loans floating and another 41 percent of loans variable as of March 31, 2022.Yields on net loans, loans held for sale, and leases excluding accretion, were 3.96 percent for the first quarter of 2022, compared with 4.06 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021, while yields on total interest earning assets were 3.10 percent for the first quarter of 2022, compared with 3.11 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021. The average cost of deposits declined to 0.15 percent for the first quarter of 2022, compared with 0.17 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021. Net interest income for the first quarter of 2022 included $17.7 million in accretion income related to acquired loans and leases, adding approximately 17 basis points to the net interest margin. This compares to net accretion income of $16.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, which added approximately 17 basis points to the fourth quarter 2021 net interest margin. Excluding the impact of accretion, the linked quarter net interest margin increased by 3 basis points.Balance Sheet ActivityLoans and leases, net of unearned income, continued to reflect solid growth, increasing $306.7 million, or 4.6 percent annualized, to $27.2 billion during the first quarter of 2022 while deposits and customer repos increased $766.8 million, or 7.7 percent annualized, to $41.3 billion. Loan growth for the quarter was primarily within the commercial and industrial portfolio while deposit growth was largely attributable to increases in noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts. The first quarter has been a strong deposit growth quarter historically as a result of seasonality in municipal deposit account balances. The first quarter of 2022 ended with a loan to deposit ratio of 67.0 percent and securities to total assets of 30.4 percent, reflecting continued strong balance sheet liquidity. Noninterest bearing deposits represented 35.6 percent of total deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2022, representing an increase from 34.2 percent at December 31, 2021. Provision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit LossesCredit metrics for the first quarter of 2022 continued to reflect improvement compared to the linked quarter including net recoveries and a meaningful decrease in non-performing loans.Total non-performing loans and leases were $119.3 million at March 31, 2022, or 0.44 percent of total net loans and leases, representing a decline of $34.5 million or 22.4 percent, from the December 31, 2021 balance of $153.8 million or 0.57 percent of total net loans and leases. Other real estate owned and other repossessed assets also declined to $28.4 million at March 31, 2022, a decrease of $2.2 million or 14.0 percent, from the December 31, 2021 balance of $33.0 million.Net recoveries for the first quarter of 2022 were $0.4 million, or 0.01 percent of net loans and leases on an annualized basis, compared with net charge-offs of $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2021 and net recoveries of $4.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Earnings for the first quarter of 2022 reflected no recorded provision for credit losses, compared with no recorded provision for the first quarter of 2021 and a provision for credit losses of $133.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The provision for the fourth quarter of 2021 includes $132.1 million associated with day one accounting provision required for loans and unfunded commitments acquired during the quarter from the legacy Cadence merger. The allowance for credit losses remains robust at $438.7 million, or 1.61 percent of net loans and leases at March 31, 2022, compared with $446.4 million, or 1.66 percent of net loans and leases at December 31, 2021. Noninterest RevenueNoninterest revenue was $128.4 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $87.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $103.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The linked quarter increase was driven by a full quarter of legacy Cadence results as well as an increase in mortgage revenue as a result of increased mortgage servicing rights valuation. The net return from mortgage servicing rights was $14.0 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Mortgage production and servicing revenue was impacted by both seasonality and rising rates, totaling $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $17.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $8.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Mortgage origination volume for the first quarter of 2022 was $803.9 million, compared with $789.8 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $817.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Insurance commission revenue reflected strong seasonal performance at $35.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $30.7 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $32.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The first quarter of the year has historically been strong due to timing of annual renewals.The full quarter's impact of the legacy Cadence merger drove the linked quarter increases in wealth management revenue, deposit service fees and other noninterest revenue. Wealth management revenue was $21.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $16.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, deposit service charge revenue was $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared with $17.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, and other noninterest revenue was $18.3 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $14.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Credit card, debit card and merchant fee revenue was $12.1 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $12.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 reflecting seasonally soft first quarter fees.Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $291.7 million, compared with $155.8 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $289.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $281.0 million, compared with $154.2 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $239.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.5 percent for the first quarter of 2022, stable as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in adjusted noninterest expense compared to the linked quarter was due to a full quarter of the legacy Cadence merger as well as seasonally higher compensation costs including payroll taxes and 401k match, partially offset by initial efficiencies associated with the legacy Cadence merger. Adjusted noninterest expense excludes merger expense included as a separate line item on the income statement as well as incremental merger related expenses that are included in the respective expense categories. Merger expenses represent costs to complete the merger with no future benefit, while incremental merger related expenses represent costs to complete the merger for which the entity receives a future benefit. Merger expense was $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2021 and $44.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Merger expense for the first quarter of 2022 was comprised primarily of contract and conversion related expenses as well as compensation related items. Incremental merger related expenses for the first quarter of 2022 totaled $6.6 million that included primarily employee retention and marketing related expenses.Capital ManagementTotal shareholder's equity was $4.64 billion at March 31, 2021 compared with $2.83 billion at March 31, 2021 and $5.25 billion at December 31, 2021. The decline in the linked quarter is largely due to a decline in Other Comprehensive Income (""OCI"") due to increased unrealized losses in the available-for-sale securities portfolio driven by changes in valuation due to the significant changes in interest rates in the quarter. In addition to the OCI change, shareholder's equity was impacted by dividends and share repurchases, partially offset by earnings.The Company's ratio of shareholders' equity to assets was 9.84 percent at March 31, 2022, compared with 10.95 percent at March 31, 2021 and 11.01 percent at December 31, 2021. The ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets was 6.31 percent at March 31, 2022, compared with 7.04 percent at March 31, 2021 and 7.54 percent at December 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company repurchased 5.1 million shares of its common stock pursuant to its share repurchase program. The company has 4.9 million shares remaining on its current share repurchase authorization which will expire December 30, 2022. Additionally during the first quarter of 2022, the Company increased its quarterly common share dividend to $0.22 per common share, representing the 10th continuous year of increased dividends.Estimated regulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2022 included Common Equity Tier 1 capital of 10.57 percent, Tier 1 capital of 11.05 percent, Total risk-based capital of 13.27 percent, and Tier 1 leverage capital of 8.24 percent.

The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures in this release for the applicable periods presented. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provides important supplemental information that contributes to a proper understanding of the Company's capital position and adjusted performance, (ii) enables a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and (iii) allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP financial measures, and the Company strongly encourages investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this news release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure.

Following a seed round that closed in MayMore news about: Wisq","Wisq","True Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Shasta Ventures Back Social Connection Platform REDWOOD CITY, Calif., April 25, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisq, the first platform designed for the social connection needs of employees, announced today that it closed $20 million in Series A funding led by Norwest Venture Partners with participation from True Ventures and Shasta Ventures. Following a seed round that closed in May 2021, Wisq has raised more than $40 million to fuel its growth and expand its platform and team.""The decline in social well-being in the workplace was significantly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic – and the cost to U.S. companies and their people is staggering,"" said Jeff Crowe, managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners. ""Wisq is tackling this problem head-on with a platform that employers and employees have been missing – a mechanism to build social connections among our co-workers, no matter where they are. With a founding team from Glint that includes CEO Jim Barnett, who I worked with at three different ventures, Wisq is on an exciting mission to radically transform the way we work together.""Workplace Connections Lacking Amid a Social Well-Being Pandemic Studies show that building close relationships with colleagues and having a strong sense of belonging at work are among the most important drivers of employee engagement and can be solutions to overcoming feelings of disconnection and isolation. As we have moved to more digital work collaboration and remote and hybrid work environments, the workplace has fundamentally changed and profoundly impacted its people and culture. Consider the following:According to Pew Research, 65% of workers who rarely or never teleworked before the pandemic say they feel less connected to co-workers now.The cost of this employee disconnection to U.S. companies is $406 billion. Cigna research revealed that lonely employees have a higher risk of turnover, lower productivity, more missed days at work and lower quality of work. Generation Z workers, who have grown up accustomed to digital social interactions, are twice as likely than Gen Xers and Baby Boomers to look for a new job within a year if they do not feel connected or like their workplace culture, a Bankrate survey revealed. Employees who feel a high level of belonging are less likely to leave their job, will perform better in their job, take fewer sick days and give higher employer promoter scores, according to BetterUp.Wisq Fosters Stronger Social Connections and Feelings of Belonging""Social connections increase employee engagement, job satisfaction and employer loyalty and are critical factors at a time when people are quick to jump ship to the next opportunity,"" said Wisq's Barnett. ""It is incumbent that business leaders foster authentic social moments as an essential part of the workday. It's time for business leaders to adopt new technology, new behavior patterns and new business culture values that align with today's workforce. We designed Wisq to be the platform that makes all of this possible, to provide a space for life at work.""The Wisq platform enables social connections and enhances a sense of belonging and social well-being for both virtual employees and those in physical locations, actively working to mitigate the feelings of isolation and contributing to an organization's performance, culture and retention rates. Unlike traditional work productivity and engagement tools or consumer social media platforms, Wisq has created the only comprehensive platform that fosters social well-being at work and supports the basic needs of employees, like connection, belonging and community. With smart profiles, intuitive sharing, community building and audio lounges for informal hangouts, Wisq helps organizations build happy work cultures. The artificial intelligence (AI) discovery platform facilitates connections and fuels authentic engagement for employees, creating a supportive environment across hallways and continents. There are various work and social entry points into the Wisq platform. Early beta customers whose employees are engaging with Wisq are seeing benefits in four key areas: Belonging: Cultivating a sense of belonging by allowing employees to connect, share and build relationships.Onboarding: Quickly instilling a sense of community and belonging during the new hire onboarding process. Growth: Consistently building, maintaining and growing employee relationships to foster social connections, develop friendships and improve team dynamics. Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): Enabling the formation of communities around shared interests, values, identities and backgrounds while providing the support and resources needed.""Remote team members are now a massive part of the workforce and they crave – more than ever – human connection and a sense of belonging at work,"" said Jon Callaghan, co-founder of True Ventures. ""We've recommitted to Wisq's Series A after leading the team's seed round because the market is in need of a platform that fosters social connection, camaraderie and better team collaboration whether those team members are in an office or working from elsewhere. The Wisq team is deeply committed to the employee experience and growing this space in the right direction.""""As Generation Z enters the workforce, they come with expectations of making digital connections in all aspects of their lives, even day-to-day on the job, whether they're working remotely or in the office,"" said Jason Pressman, managing director at Shasta Ventures. ""Providing a platform like Wisq is no longer a 'nice-to-have.' It's a 'must-have' benefit for the future of work in a competitive market where companies are seeking unique ways to attract and retain the next generation of employees.""Companies interested in beta participation can sign up here.About WisqWisq is a space for life at work.
