removed     <- 1-susceptible-infected #sometimes Recovered, these are people that will not be reinfected again, i.e. who is left for the virus to infect
totalDays   <- 70

# Virus Behavior
betaVal  <- 1.4247 #infection rate; how many people are infected for each person
gammaVal <- 0.14286 #recovery rate; rate an infected recovers & moves to removed

# Organize into named vectors

# Using Covid infection & recovery from papers as of May 2020
betaVal  <- 1.75 #10 infected people will infect 17.5 people "how much movement is going on"
gammaVal <- .5 #R0 (Rate of recovery) = beta/gamma 
# A paper said China recovered minus death div infected =(47367-2945)/80151 cited in a paper from May21 = 0.5542289; 
## Gamma of 0.5 means 1/2 of an infected person is recovering each day
#R0 was said to be ~3.5 in papers and means
# beta/gamma = R0
# 1.75 / gamma = 3.5
# 1.75 = 3.5 * gamma
# 1.75 / 3.5 = gamma
# 0.5 = gamma

sirC <- SIR(pars = c(beta = betaVal, gamma = gammaVal), 
           init = initials, time = 0:totalDays)
# Plot the actual covid curves

# Let's apply some social distancing to decrease the infection rate
betaVal  <- 1.1 #when a person is infected they will infect 1.1 more people instead of 1.75
gammaVal <- .5 #recovery is the same, but in reality new treatments improve this over time
sirD <- SIR(pars = c(beta = betaVal, gamma = gammaVal), 
           init = initials, time = 0:totalDays)
PlotMods(sirD)

# Plot the infection curves next to each other, the social distanced one is lower meaning hospitals aren't overwhelmed and more people will recover vs die in the removed state.
# Recovery line is stretched out on x-axis
plot(sirC$results$R, col='darkred', type ='l',  lwd = 5)
lines(sirD$results$R, col='darkgreen',  lwd = 5)

# Infected line is not as high, meaning the capacity for care is less strained
plot(sirC$results$I, col='darkred', type ='l',  lwd = 5)
lines(sirD$results$I, col='darkgreen',  lwd = 5)

# Conclusion
# Keep in mind this a toy example to show how these factors interact.
# Issues of personal behavior like distancing, masking and not traveling/going to gatherings, spreading in different locations (coastal, south, upper midwest basically starts the process over in three+ waves), uneven access to healthcare in rural vs urban and systemic issues related to race all impact these curves.
