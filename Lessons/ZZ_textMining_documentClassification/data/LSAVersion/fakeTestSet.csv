The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer   probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory    kick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume   at the end of the month/quarter/whatever.

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.  The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced, translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.  Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages a court would award.  However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit, almost certainly it is ""obvious to one skilled in the art"" and therefore unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory) cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.  Caution:  I am not a lawyer.

Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness.

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reason they are considered ""cleaner"" is because they are better at the emissions we actually measure and regulate.

It's a very good not-necessarily-technical guide to the Internet and the various utilities that lurk on it (including USENET).

First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of  major failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water (that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes  through the cooling tower).

The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used. Older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them. These days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). The light and dark green boards ofter seen have a ""dry film"" mask applied to them (usually applied as a complete film photographically produced). The blue (and red or orange) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist formulation and are applied in a different manner.

There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the  Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up. Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words, if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat. Cheers, Corwin"

Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available via anonymous ftp at 'csus.edu'.  Since you've chosen the 27C512 you are probably trying to make a 'multicart'. To do this simply: 1. Load the game images into the EEPROM at $2000, $4000, etc. (Your EEPROM burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into one file yourself with suitable gaps.) 2. Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game console, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games.  To directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address' is simply another address line.  For a concrete example, with the 27C512 and 8K games images, you would wire A0-A12 to the cartridge, and A13-A15 to 3 switches.  The 3 switches would allow you to pick from the 8 games on the EEPROM.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.  IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely ""abberant"".  ----  ET   ""Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes."" ----"

All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches later on.  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably know BMW's are not cheap to fix either.  The owner sounds like a shady character just trying to take advantage of someone. Sure $ 3000 sounds good but you should calculate how much the repairs will be. It sounds like you would have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more. Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned. Who knows how many miles are on it and how it was driven.  Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear. For all you know it could have 200,000 miles on it.  The thing you have to remember is that this isn't the last 528i around either. Just wait and keep shopping. For around $ 5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better, needs less repair, and has legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering. Take it from a guy who has been taken a couple of times. Good luck. Al Himsl"

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on my 90 Prelude. See rec.autos.tech for more detail. My problem is a false engagement point below the actual one.

Call up Crown, the company that has the patent on the PZM, and ask them for information on construction and use of the things.  You may have to determine the correct spacing emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the design of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of the electret element to increase the high frequency response, and you are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance.  Crown has a nice book on the subject, though it's unfortunately rather short on mathematics.  There's a JAES article from many years back, too.  Still, for your application, you'll be a lot better off buying the cheap Radio Shack models and using Phil Rastoczny's modifications to get a clean balanced output.

If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!""  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands ""quieter"" than others?  ============================================================================== Randy T.

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a purse.  If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the need for functional women's clothing.

You raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff -- how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection?  You could buy a Volvo, Saab, or 'Benz and get really good crash protection (and other luxuries) but you'll pay significantly more for it.  In my case it's out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget.  Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old 3-point seatbelt.  Nowadays, at least in the US, you get an airbag if you get a 3-point belt so (presumably) you get an added safety benefit there as well.  That's something I certainly look for and which can be had in inexpensive cars.  My $.02, of course.  jim frost jimf@centerline.com"

Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.  >And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ... >Hello , this is the 90 's ?  Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.  Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the ""pony car"" class came from) with a performance model. That's why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet  accessible--with room for performance tweaking.  The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche, and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least, does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

Here's a summary of the replies I received.         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I'm not under 25 anymore (but is 27 close enough).   1992 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (300hp model). No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1, airbag, abs, security alarm, single.   $1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.   After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.   I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.   Hope this helps.   Steve Flynn University of Delaware ======================================================================== 45       Kevin:       (Hope I remembered your name correctly)...       You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year     I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the     same inquiry as you.       Age: 24 (then and now)     Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD     Driving Record: Clean     State: Illinois     Cost: $820/6 mos.       I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos.     Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.       I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more     than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe I'm just lucky.       Hope the info helps.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   ""If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   ""If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.""   ""But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.""    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.""   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\| |\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ ||\|\  \_|\/|_|/|)[_|\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

I had not had any accidents before or after, this was strictly an age change.  That same rate stayed pretty much the same until I sold the car 2 years ago.  My F-150 pickup is about $80/year less.

I don't have one of the performance cars you listed, but if your record is clean, then you should not be paying over $2K.   Did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find? Although rates are supposed to be standardized, I've found that most places I initially call, give me some ridiculously high quote and *finaly*, I hit one that is much lower.   Also, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at renewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a low rate.  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance companies 8^).   Good luck, Serge"

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live.  If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1)	ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2)	a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing? I hope I helped somewhat.  ************************************************************************ Jason Yow				Human Factors Psychology Program Wright State University, Dayton, OH	E-mail: jyow@desire.wright.edu ************************************************************************"

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.

It should be added that this technique of automatic substitutions into orders, i.e. the machine's ability to modify its own orders (under the control of other ones among its orders) is absolutely necessary for a flexible code. Thus, if part of the memory is used as a ""function table"", then ""looking up"" a value of that function for a value of the  variable which is obtained in the course of the computation requires that the machine itself should modify, or rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which controls this ""looking up"", and the machine can only make this modification after it has already calculated the value of the  variable in question.

As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many >fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive >contamination.         Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water, rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal  pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"".

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.   I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.  Mark"

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB. So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.  For power:    dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )  For amplitude    dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )  'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel. It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.  Common references for audio are:  	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms 	0 dBV = 1 volt  	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level) 	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)   Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment.  Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm's law.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

I got several e-mails and therefore I wrote this summary:  It seems that there are two public domain tools available.  The first one is called 'chipmunk' and is available at   hobiecat.caltech.edu or in europe at ifi.uio.no. In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool  (schematic editor, layout editor, LVS, DRC...). The schematic editor   itself is called LOG.  The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS'. It is also a complete VLSI package. The fully uncompressed release takes about 130Mb of disk space.   It should be available at Berkley.  That's all I got so far.

Are the boards at all intelligent?  (I.e., run by microcontrollers?)  The easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the boards is talking to the PC.  When this line was true, the other boards could all hold off and not send their data.  This isn't a perfect solution, though, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't decide to talk at the _exact same time_.  Other than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to ""something"" that speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it used to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPS or slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex the data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first paragraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more than 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to be able to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)  You might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC, though.  I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports, 4 RS-232 ports) for a very reasonable $85.  					---Joel Kolstad"

I'd driven it since the previous July, putting 20k miles on it.  The sensor light used to light up regularly, starting about 5k miles after I bought it.   My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment, so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement.  Performance (hah, if you could call it that) did not change.  Perhaps emissions increased, but how much emissions could a CA-registered 3 cylinder engine produce? That was a neat car, I held the engine block easily in one hand!  Has anyone ever driven the 'Turbo' variant?  Just curious...  	Adam Edwards awds_ltd@uhura.cc.rochester.edu  "

I'd like to see this info as well.  As for wavelength, I think you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM +/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940. I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of difference.  	Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote, and go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding specs. if the system uses that.

There is virtual certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset control's zero detent position.  2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out .4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may also find that loading the output of the function generator also reduces the harmonic distortion.  Build an attenuator.

This chatter started when I moved to the San  Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.

The material used to make them goes by two names.  If it is used to make circuit boards it is called FR-4.  The same material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a structural material and is called G-10.  FR-4 and G-10 are both green.  They are not green because of a solder masking agent.  The basic ingredients are a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers.  I am not sure what the specs are on the resin, but if you are really curious you can call NEMA (National Electronics Manufacturing Association) or Ciba Geigy (a major manufacturer of epoxy resins) to find out.  As an aside, I occasionally mix clear epoxy and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments. The proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in G-10.  They are the same green color."

The electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch. On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.  The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology.  It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer.  Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about $US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield) cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer between the two technologies.

When that light goes on, I just take it to the delaer tell them ""It's that time"" and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor) I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten. Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.    What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light will go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't find it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little and good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?  				- Thomas -  ****************************************************************************** *  E-Mail Address: 		  *  ""Give me an an army of West Point,      * *	TJZ6624@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU	  *   graduates and I'll win a battle...     * *				  *   Give me a handful of Texas Aggies,     * *  ""Creator of MOT POWER!""	  *   and I'll win a war.""                   * *				  *	  - Gen.

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones (BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might call MCL; they have a nice catalog.  The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output voltage as possible. (about 260v).   The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.   Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.  If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem. These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of them, So:  1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel  with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?   Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone... as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new capacitor will 'smooth' this out.  and 2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !    I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my  dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

This suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds.  Years ago in another time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.  So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container.

Likewise, if anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.  I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power transformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be real difficult at 15 KHz).  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water at 25 C), and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring, or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery.  (I am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be wrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel like thinking through it right now.)   What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be, is exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes (acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals may form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds. The reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery charger) is put back into the battery.   Lead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts (terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric energy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it has a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So while keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.   To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's Principle, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position.  Here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials:                                                 thermal conductivity        material           Temperature, C (F)  BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft)        --------           ------------------  -------------------- diatomaceous earth,            204                   0.051  natural, across strata        871                   0.077 diatomaceous, natural,         204                   0.081  parallel to strata            871                   0.106 diatomaceous earth powder     (100)                  0.039   (density, 18 lb/cu.ft)      (200)                  0.042                               (300)                  0.044                               (400)                  0.048                               (500)                  0.051 concrete (cinder)              ---                   0.20          (stone)               ---                   0.54          (1:4 dry)             ---                   0.44 pine (across grain)             15                   0.087    (parallel to grain)          21                   0.20 oak (across grain)              15                   0.12 maple (across grain)            50                   0.11   Note that the thermal conductivity for ""dirt"" (diatomaceous earth) goes down with temperature.  Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4 times greater than wood.   It is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the discharge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity or heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).) During storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature, the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster than that on dirt.   This is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play.  Removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the reaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which ""pulls"" the reaction along.

Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I (knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty high-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with torque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the highway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I  probably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been around 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the ""control"" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out to be very convenient.  It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in  ""we-like-to-control-your-life Massachusetts"" :-)   >>No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)

Having driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension ""interesting"". The car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.  >>If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.

Well I wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As mentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, ""consider the back seat as a parcel shelf"".  No biggie to me though (if it had been, I'd not have bought the car!

I went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO.  Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers.
